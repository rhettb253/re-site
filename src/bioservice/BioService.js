                        Desiring to help people and build lasting relationships is at the heart of all I do. Born and raised in the Tri-Cities area of Eastern Washington, with a lifelong passion for volunteering in the community and a love for the real estate industry, I am a neighborhood expert and real estate advisor serving Benton and Franklin counties. I lived in Seattle for ten years and spent the last five as a real estate agent for Windermere in West Seattle. As of January, I decided to move back to my roots and switched brokerages to join eXp, which will still allow me to service friends or family in Seattle area when needed, but turn my main focus back to my hometown of Tri-Cities.

                        Whether selling or buying a home, it is one of the largest transactions you will make in your life, and that is not something I take lightly. If you consider my local knowledge, combined with negotiation skills, strategic marketing, financial savviness, project management experience, enthusiastic energy, and meticulous eye for detail, not to mention my track record of closed sales and happy clients, I believe I offer the complete package to help you make this large and important transaction a successful one.

                        <strong>Here are my 5 promises to help you get the most value at the top of the range:</strong>
                        <br/><br/>
                        1. We’ll walk through your property together and I’ll show you ways to enhance the value so you get top dollar for it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        2. I’ll help you with a pricing strategy – not pricing it too high so you scare buyers away or too low so you leave money on the table.
                        <br/><br/>
                        3. My marketing plan will give you maximum exposure, so we attract more buyers and more contracts. The more buyers and contracts you have, the higher your property will sell.
                        <br/><br/>
                        4. I’ll help you negotiate the best contract. Negotiation is an important skill in any market.
                        <br/><br/>
                        5. I’m your transaction manager. There are a lot of moving parts. My job is to handle those parts so your contract closes on time.

                        <strong> If we work together, the following items will be arranged for you or provided:</strong>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong>Pre-inspection:</strong> An inspector will go through your home to see if there are any areas of concern. Knowing any repairs needed helps you decide what you’d like to fix before selling, and also will make buyers feel more confident and secure in knowing what they are buying. Either way, I believe this puts you in the strongest negotiating position possible, but it isn’t necessary to sell your home. This is paid by the seller if they choose to move forward with pre-inspection.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Staging consultation:</strong> I will walk through your home and offer suggestions to ensure your home shows in the most favorable light. This could mean putting things in storage, moving furniture around or minor repair work. We will work together to plan and prioritize the items you would like to complete before we begin marketing your home. During this meeting, we can discuss whether you would like to pay for staging or list it as a blank canvas.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Landscaping:</strong> Creating a positive first impression is critical. We will provide a curb appeal consultation that is done with recommendations for yard or exterior improvements.
<br/><br/>
<strong>HD Photography:</strong> Research shows that multiple, high quality photos sell houses. Your home will be photographed using HD technology for our marketing materials and on-line photo gallery. I happily pay for professional photography for my clients because, back to first impressions, I believe excellent photos bring buyers as most homes are first seen online before someone decides to take a tour or come to an open house.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Concierge Service:</strong> If there is a need for additional work, we can help with access to our service providers for every aspect of preparing your home for sale. This may be just getting bids or finding a specialized contractor for repairs or other needs.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Preliminary Title Search:</strong> I order a pre-title commitment to reduce your risk of any title problems at closing.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Open Houses:</strong> Holding an open allows any neighbors and prospective buyers to come and look at the home. The open house will be advertised on Washington’s Multiple Listing Service for agents across the state to see, as well as many online websites such as Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, and more. I will hold your home open on the days that we agree upon, but typically Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday during the first week on the market. After the second week, I will hold it open at least one day of the weekend, or again, as often as makes sense based on buyer traffic.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Online Advertising:</strong> I will publish your home on all forms of social media accounts (Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Google+, Zillow), eXp’s social Workplace website, and via inter-office marketing.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Feature Cards:</strong> Feature Cards are signs that point out the not so obvious features that a buyer may miss, (i.e., “Don’t miss the hidden storage behind the stairs” or “New Roof”). I provide these cards and place them around the property to help guide buyers. If you would rather them not be hung that is also completely fine.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Property Profile:</strong> We prepare an information book or “Homebook” containing information a buyer will want to know including “Facts and Figures”, “What You Love..”, the area, schools, average utilities, homeowners association (if there is one), the pre-inspection, disclosures, contracts, potential bids, etc. This information will give buyers the confidence to write a contract.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Showing Follow-up:</strong> I will follow-up with agents who have either shown or previewed your home by making a phone call, and then sending them a personalized email if we don’t connect over the phone. This feedback can help us judge their client’s level of interest, our pricing, and adjust our strategy if needed to stay competitive.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Agent Tour:</strong> Fellow eXp agents in the area will tour the home and not only be exposed to your home to decide if they have clients that may be interested, but they will also provide us with feedback regarding price, staging, condition of the home, and other items.
Promote to Top Agents in Your Area: We present your property to the top-selling agents in the area. Agents that have sold a listing in your neighborhood within the last six months may have buyers waiting. We want the most active agents to get special notifications of your home’s availability. I accomplish this through phone call and email marketing.
