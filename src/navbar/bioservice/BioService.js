                        <p className="indent">Desiring to help people and build lasting relationships is at the heart of all I do. Born and raised in the Tri-Cities area of Eastern Washington, with a lifelong passion for volunteering in the community and a love for the real estate industry, I am a neighborhood expert and real estate advisor serving Benton and Franklin counties. I lived in Seattle for ten years and spent the last five as a real estate agent for Windermere in West Seattle. As of January, I decided to move back to my roots and switched brokerages to join eXp, which will still allow me to service friends or family in Seattle area when needed, but turn my main focus back to my hometown of Tri-Cities.

                        <p className='indent'>Whether selling or buying a home, it is one of the largest transactions you will make in your life, and that is not something I take lightly. If you consider my local knowledge, combined with negotiation skills, strategic marketing, financial savviness, project management experience, enthusiastic energy, and meticulous eye for detail, not to mention my track record of closed sales and happy clients, I believe I offer the complete package to help you make this large and important transaction a successful one.

                    <h1>TOP VALUE PROMISES</h1>
                        <p>Here are my 5 promises to help you get the most value at the top of the range:
                        </p>
                        <p>1. “We’ll walk through your property together and I’ll show you ways to enhance the value so you get top dollar for it.”
<br/><br/>
2. “I’ll help you with a pricing strategy – not pricing it too high so you scare buyers away or too low so you leave money on the table.”
<br/><br/>
3. “My marketing plan will give you maximum exposure, so we attract more buyers and more contracts. The more buyers and contracts you have, the higher your property will sell.”
<br/><br/>
4. “I’ll help you negotiate the best contract. Negotiation is an important skill in any market.”
<br/><br/>
5. “I’m your transaction manager. There are a lot of moving parts. My job is to handle those parts so your contract closes on time.”</p>
